Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Davide!

I live in Turin, IT ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, I love writing coloured codes in dark backgrounds.
I'm actually attending an hard (very hard ðŸ¥µ) coding bootcamp called EPICODE. These are the tech skills I've learned since I begun:

â€¢ HTML
â€¢ CSS
â€¢ SASS
â€¢ BOOTSTRAP
â€¢ JAVASCRIPT
â€¢ TYPESCRIPT
â€¢ ANGULAR
â€¢ Not trusting those ones who use light themes ðŸ˜…

I'm currently looking for my first oppurtunity in the IT Industry, so if you find interesting my repos, you can get in touch with me here: borotto.davide@gmail.com

When I'm not working in front of my PC, I love to do many things:

Scuba Diving |
Climbing |
Writing Music |
Trekking |
Traveling
